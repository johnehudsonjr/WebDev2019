# Overview
For project #1, I created a Welcome to Atlanta - Jeopardy style trivia game.
The game is currently a one player game where the user picks a question and then an answer shows on the side of the screen and they have to answer the question.

# Background

My initial plan was to code the game in a way that was less logical yet worked very well. This would have been a lot less complicated for me. I took the route that was logical/ DRY and a few elements that I want to work, do not work. This is a learning area for me because I will next time do the way that I am 100% confident in and work to clean up code later.

# Moving Forward

I plan to take this as a lesson and do the way that I am more confident in and then work to make the code more DRY (not repeating myself in certain areas).

# Live site

Here is a link to play the game online: https://musing-ramanujan-cc3d12.netlify.com/

# Future Development
The initial vision of the project was to create a fun trivia game to highlight the top attractions for people to do when visiting or planning to relocate to Atlanta. Think, a product for the chamber of commerce to advertise on their website as well as maybe in the airport.

To do this, I want to make the questions and answers pop up in a modal with pictures and links to the attractions.
I want to also include links to purchase tickets as well as other important information like hours of operation.
I plan to make this site responsive and add a two player element. I also would like to include a "leaderboard" that allows user to input their name and see how they rank against other players.
